## Description

This project is a reimagining of the site [Termo](https://term.ooo/). It provides a frontend built with Angular and styled with SCSS.
It consumes the backend API [GuessCat](https://github.com/eriksgda/API-guesscat) via Angular Services, using HttpClient to fetch and send user and game data.
Routing is secured with Guards, which blocks unauthorized users to the login/sign-up screen.


### Game logic:

A random word is selected, and the player has a number of attempts equal to the word's length to guess it.
